# ESC Firmware

This folder contains all the firmware prepared for the ESC project. Earlier firmware was written in the Arduino IDE (1.8.13) but more recent versions have been written in PlatformIO using the Arduino platform.

- `esc_vX_firmware` is the firmware prepared for that respective version of ESC hardware
- `i2c_tester` is a utility to be run on any I2C-enabled microcontroller to communicate with the ESCs over I2C
