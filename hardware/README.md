# ESC Hardware Files

Here are the files related to the hardware design. They are all from KiCad 7.0.10 at the oldest.

## Projects

- `esc_vX` are different versions of the ESC
- `driver_ic_adapter` is a board I designed to act as an adapter so I could seat an IRS2334S chip on the footprint for a FAN7x88 chip
- `esc_driver` is a board just meant to hold the power stage of the ESC so one can connect it to different control circuits

## Other Files and Folders

- `esc.3dshapes` contains 3D models for custom footpints
- `esc.pretty` holds all the custom footprints needed by the ESC project
- `schematics` has the schematics in PDF (colour and B/W) and SVG (just colour) formats
- `esc_part.kicad_sym` holds the custom symbols used in the ESC project
- `small_title_block.kicad_wks` has the worksheet template with a more compact titleblock
